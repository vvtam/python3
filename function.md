## function

### Summary:

Function in Python is a piece of reusable code that is used to perform single, related action. In this article, we will see

- Function defined by the **def** statement
- The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and should be indented (space)
- Any arguments or input parameters should be placed within these parentheses, etc.
- At least one indent should be left before the code after declaring function
- Same indent style should be maintained throughout the code within def function
- For best practices three or four indents are considered best before the statement
- You can use the "return" command to return values to the function call.
- Python will print a random value like (0x021B2D30) when the argument is not supplied to the calling function. Example "print function."
- On the calling side, it is an argument and on the function side it is a parameter
- Default value in argument - When we supply only one argument while calling multiply function or any other function, Python assigns the other argument by default
- Python enables you to reverse the order of the argument as well
