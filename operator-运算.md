### Summary:

Operators in a programming language are used to perform various operations on values and variables. In Python, you can use operators like

- There are various methods for arithmetic calculation in Python as you can use the eval function, declare variable & calculate, or call functions
- Comparison operators often referred as relational operators are used to compare the values on either side of them and determine the relation between them
- Python assignment operators are simply to assign the value to variable
- Python also allows you to use a compound assignment operator, in a complicated arithmetic calculation, where you can assign the result of one operand to the other
- For AND operator â€“ It returns TRUE if both the operands (right side and left side) are true
- For OR operator- It returns TRUE if either of the operand (right side or left side) is true
- For NOT operator- returns TRUE if operand is false
- There are two membership operators that are used in Python. (in, not in).
- It gives the result based on the variable present in specified sequence or string
- The two identify operators used in Python are (is, is not)
- It returns true if two variables point the same object and false otherwise
- Precedence operator can be useful when you have to set priority for which calculation need to be done first in a complex calculation.
