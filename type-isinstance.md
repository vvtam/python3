### Summary:

- Python has a built-in function called type() that helps you find the class type of the variable given as input. For example, if the input is a string, you will get the output as <class 'str'>, for the list, it will be <class 'list'>, etc.
- For type(), you can pass a single argument, and the return value will be the class type of the argument given, e.g., type(object).
- It is also possible to pass three arguments to type(), i.e., type(name, bases, dict), in such case, it will return you a new type object.
- Python has a built-in function called instance() that compares the value with the type given. It the value and type given matches it will return true otherwise false. Using isinstance(), you can test for string, float, int, list, tuple, dict, set, class, etc.
- Using isinstance() method, you can test for string, float, int, list, tuple, dict, set, class, etc.
