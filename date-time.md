### Summary

For manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways datetime module supplies different classes or categories like

- date – Manipulate just date ( Month, day, year)
- time – Time independent of the day (Hour, minute, second, microsecond)
- datetime – Combination of time and date (Month, day, year, hour, second, microsecond)
- timedelta— A duration of time used for manipulating dates
- tzinfo— An abstract class for dealing with timezones

**Using datetime objects**

- Importing datetime objects before executing the code is mandatory
- Using date.today function for printing individual date/month/year as well as indexing the day
- Using date.time object to get time in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds

**Formatting Time-Out with "str f time function"**

- Use "str f time function" to change the format of the year
- Print day, date, month and year separately,
- Call out time for any format 12 hrs or 24 hrs

**Timedelta Objects**

- With timedelta objects, you can estimate the time for both future and the past
- Calculate the total days left for the special day(birthday) from the current time
- Calculate the total days passed for special day(birthday) from the current time
