### Summary:

"Class" is a logical grouping of functions and data. Python class provides all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming.

- Class inheritance mechanism
- A derived class that override any method of its base class
- A method can call the method of a base class with the same name
- Python Classes are defined by keyword **"class"** itself
- Inside classes, you can define functions or methods that are part of the class
- Everything in a class is indented, just like the code in the function, loop, if statement, etc.
- The self argument in Python refers to the object itself. Self is the name preferred by convention by Pythons to indicate the first parameter of instance methods in Python
- Python runtime will pass "self" value automatically when you call an instance method on in instance, whether you provide it deliberately or not
- In Python, a class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another class called subclass or heir class.
