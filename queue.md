### Summary:

- A queue is a container that holds data. There are two types of Queue, FIFO, and LIFO.
- For a FIFO (First in First out Queue), the element that goes first will be the first to come out.
- For a LIFO (Last in First out Queue), the element that is entered last will be the first to come out.
- An item in a queue is added using the put(item) method.
- To remove an item, get() method is used.
