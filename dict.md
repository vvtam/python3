### Summary:

Dictionaries in a programming language is a type of data-structure used to store information connected in someway. Python Dictionary are defined into two elements Keys and Values. Dictionaries do not store their information in any particular order, so you may not get your information back in the same order you entered it.

- Keys will be a single element
- Values can be a list or list within a list, numbers, etc.
- More than one entry per key is not allowed ( no duplicate key is allowed)
- The values in the dictionary can be of any type while the keys must be immutable like numbers, tuples or strings.
- Dictionary keys are case sensitive- Same key name but with the different case are treated as different keys in Python dictionaries.
