### Summary

- Python map() is a built-in function that applies a function on all the items of an iterator given as input. An iterator, for example, can be a list, a tuple, a string, etc. and it returns an iterable map object.
- The map() function is going to apply the given function on all the items inside the iterator and return an iterable map object i.e a tuple, a list, etc.
- Python map() function is a built-in function and can also be used with other built-in functions available in Python.
- A tuple is an object in Python that has items separated by commas and enclosed in round brackets. In the example will take a tuple with string values. The function that we will use will convert the values given to uppercase.
- A dictionary in Python is created using curly brackets({}). Since the dictionary is an iterator, you can make use of it inside map() function.
- Set in Python is an unordered collection of items in curly brackets(()). Since set() is also an iterator, you can make use of it inside map() function.
- In Python, lambda expressions (or lambda forms) are utilized to construct anonymous functions. So the lambda keyword has to used when you want to use lambda inside the map().
- You can send more than one iterator i.e. a list, a tuple to the map() function.
